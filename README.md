# MoneyGoHappy Game
## Google T-Rex, but Better!

The game has striking similarities to the Google T-Rex game that I originally made (https://github.com/Dhruvjalan/trex-runner.git). However, it is better. Now instead of just avoiding the obstacles, you need to make the mokey gain as many of fruits as possible. 

## How to play?
Hit the space bar or the PgUp Arrow to jump above the obsacles. Try to jump over all obstacles and earn the maximum possible fruits. Once you get hit, you DIE. 

## Improvisations:
1. Make the game faster as the score increases.
2. Add a highscore

## To Play:
1. Either download the code, unzip it and run it in an IDE.
